- favor `panic!()` over `assert!()` as it is often easier to read
- do explicit fn return typing (consistency)
- do explicit returns in function (consistency)
  - one line function can use implicit returns
- if the main function can result in an unrecoverable error, it should just return the error instead of explicitly panicing
- use `tokio` for async functionality
  - seem to be the most active and used library for async
