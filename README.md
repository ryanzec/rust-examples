# Rust Examples

I am the type of person who does not try to memorize things explicitly. If I do something enough it will find it way into my memory naturally so everything else probably does not need to be in there. That being said, that does not mean I am good with forgetting everything I learn that is not naturally memorized. There have been a number of times that I know I did something a while back and when I need to do it again, I can't find the piece where I did it before to serve as a reference (maybe I did it at a previous job, that code has been removed or move some place else, etc.) so I want to avoid that issue which is the point of this repository.

As I have learning the Rust programming language, I am going to be adding in examples here for all the different concepts that I learn. I hope for this to at least serve as a reference tool I can use in the future and just maybe, someone else with find value in it.
